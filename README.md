# PackMan
Do you use Facebook? Do you have friends there? We have! And we are tired of posts, where people are looking for anyone going to place X, who can grab a package and give it to their parents/friends/etc. That’s why we have an idea, which can not only clear your Facebook wall but also improve the sharing economy. Do you go to Cracow/Warsaw/Poznań or Łódź? That’s great! Write it down on our website and help others! You can tell them how much money you want for taking a package, or maybe you want only a smile? It all depends on you! Make friends, help others, preserve the environment, because maybe one day you will be the one who left a mobile phone in hometown and need it asap.  If you want to start using the app you need to register, and depending on whether you want someone to deliver your package or be the one who delivers, you fill in a form and The app will find a mate for you with whom you can discuss the details.
Technologies we want to use to implement our website: HTML5, CSS3(Bootstrap), Python(Django), JavaScript, MySQL, and BlaBlaCar’s API.
